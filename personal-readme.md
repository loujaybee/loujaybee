## What I'm Good At

* I like to prioritise my team / colleagues before myself, I try to review open work, provide input etc before starting my own work.
* Clarifying visions or purposes. I like to dig into the why of projects to get to the underlying principles behind something. 
* I try my best to always simplify what I'm working on, if there's a good reason not to do something, I'll often choose that route. 
* People often think I am in love with processes, but I just see the use of processes (it's actually a bonus if I don't have to set them up)!
* I try to be as flexible with what I work on as I can, so I'm happy to pick up lots of different types of tasks. 

## What I'm Not Good At

* It's important for me to give people the space to talk and think, so I struggle in faster-paced conversations where interrupting is normal/expected.
* Thinking on my feet, I like to reflect and think a lot, giving me time to prepare for a conversation often helps. 
* I bias towards criticism/flaws, and move quickly onto the next thing, I'm working on giving positive feedback more.

## How To Work With Me

* In discussions I appreciate context, e.g. why are we meeting? What is the goal? This helps me adapt my input.
* I like to give freedom, rather than too much specifics, so if you need more detail, or I'm too high-level, please ask me to clarify.
* I prefer high-trust environments, over rigid processes. Failure should be a possibility, but not a "problem".
* I can come across very stoic to some, if you're unsure where I stand on something, feel free to ask.
* I tend to bias for action, especially when it comes to decisions that are "on the fence", i.e "ship it".
* I prefer casual interactions over formalities if possible, feel free to be yourself as far as you are comfortable. 

## What I Like To Be Involved In

* I'd rather work through something jointly than alone (pair / mob programming) because I find the outputs are better. 
* Given the choice I'd rather be involved in the strategy/direction of a project than the details. 

## How I Give Feedback

* I'm hesitant with feedback, as I'm always conscious of "pushing my opinion", so you might need to ask.
* I do enjoy giving feedback, give me some time to collect my thoughts and you should get good feedback!
* I like to ask questions ("coaching" style) rather than give direct feedback, as it can lead to better outcomes

## How I Like To Recieve Feedback

* I love feedback, I'm yet to meet someone who gave me "too much" feedback, so you should probably bias to more feedback than less!
* Feedback in person is best, so I can ask questions.
* A write-up does will help me to remember your points, but it's not mandatory for me.
