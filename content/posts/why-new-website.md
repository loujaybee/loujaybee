I'm starting a fresh, with the website that is. I fully "launched" originally my previous website back in 2016. And along the way made a series of mistakes, that eventually lead to the total loss of my motivation and desire to write. So I'm doing some things differently, and making a come back... but this time, things are a little bit different! 

Originally, whe vision was quite simple, and somewhat humble: share what I was learning and thinking about in a simple, candid way. For me, it was all about the content. Good writing was the absolute foundation and on top of that I wanted to have simple graphics / UI that didn't get in the way of the reading experience. So I launched a website and started on my journey into writing. 

Naturally, I set about trying to find as much information as I could on how to write, and how to publish a blog. But that's where I started to make some wrong turns...

Over this time of learning I took a lot of advice from what can only be described as how to "make a successful website". I put "successful" in quotes because of the irony in what I'm about to say... 

The advice that exists involves pharses like: "Write to a specific audience", "write only on a select topic" and "put the reader first". Which — as it turns out — _is_ _great_ advice. But... it's only good advice if your goal is to get lots of traffic and have a _super popular blog_. But, for me, this wasn't why I got into writing, not was it why I enjoyed it. 

The main benefit I get from writing is taking time to reflect on a topic close to me, to understand my own feelings. And all of the advice that was all about driving traffic, whilst useful if that is your goal, just wasn't making me happy. 

But, if that's not what I wanted, that does beg the question: **What is the new site about then?**

Well, the site will mostly be the same. Technically, I wanted an overhal so that publishing was easier and simpler for me, in line with my original goal. But mainly, regarding content it's going to be more relaxed, as I want it to be more of a journal than a targetted set of articles. 

And — really — that's it. 

If you want to follow along, you're welcome to. And please let me know if there's anything you want to hear about! And here's to (hopefully a longer) new adventure! 

Best, Lou.
