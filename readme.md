Hello I'm Lou üöÄ

I'm a Software Engineer, living in London. 

These days I'm working heavily on [Open Up The Cloud](https://openupthecloud.com/) which helps people get their start and grow their careers in cloud. 

[Open Up The Cloud](https://openupthecloud.com/) is a social enterprise, so it earns money that is re-invested in the community as giveaways, sponsorships, free certificate vouchers, etc. Open Up The Cloud has [a blog](https://openupthecloud.com) (cross-posted onto [DEV.TO](https://dev.to/loujaybee)), a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/OpenUpTheCloud), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/openupthecloud) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/openupthecloud). 

I'm also pretty active on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/loujaybee) as `loujaybee`, and always up for chatting, so feel free to reach out! 

Speak soon, Lou ‚úåÔ∏è
