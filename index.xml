      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m starting a fresh, with the website that is. I fully &amp;ldquo;launched&amp;rdquo; originally my previous website back in 2016. And along the way made a series of mistakes, that eventually lead to the total loss of my motivation and desire to write. So I&amp;rsquo;m doing some things differently, and making a come back&amp;hellip; but this time, things are a little bit different!
Originally, whe vision was quite simple, and somewhat humble: share what I was learning and thinking about in a simple, candid way.</description>

      <description>In a world of fake news and awful television I take a lot of solace in reading books. I don&amp;rsquo;t read solely for pleasure — I want the books I read to teach me, challenge me or provoke me in some way. One of the questions that I ask myself is &amp;ldquo;If I was at the absolute top of my game, what books would I know about, have read and understood?</description>
