  <div class="post-content"><p>I&rsquo;m starting a fresh, with the website that is. I fully &ldquo;launched&rdquo; originally my previous website back in 2016. And along the way made a series of mistakes, that eventually lead to the total loss of my motivation and desire to write. So I&rsquo;m doing some things differently, and making a come back&hellip; but this time, things are a little bit different!</p>

<p>Originally, whe vision was quite simple, and somewhat humble: share what I was learning and thinking about in a simple, candid way. For me, it was all about the content. Good writing was the absolute foundation and on top of that I wanted to have simple graphics / UI that didn&rsquo;t get in the way of the reading experience. So I launched a website and started on my journey into writing.</p>

<p>Naturally, I set about trying to find as much information as I could on how to write, and how to publish a blog. But that&rsquo;s where I started to make some wrong turns&hellip;</p>

<p>Over this time of learning I took a lot of advice from what can only be described as how to &ldquo;make a successful website&rdquo;. I put &ldquo;successful&rdquo; in quotes because of the irony in what I&rsquo;m about to say&hellip;</p>

<p>The advice that exists involves pharses like: &ldquo;Write to a specific audience&rdquo;, &ldquo;write only on a select topic&rdquo; and &ldquo;put the reader first&rdquo;. Which — as it turns out — <em>is</em> <em>great</em> advice. But&hellip; it&rsquo;s only good advice if your goal is to get lots of traffic and have a <em>super popular blog</em>. But, for me, this wasn&rsquo;t why I got into writing, not was it why I enjoyed it.</p>

<p>The main benefit I get from writing is taking time to reflect on a topic close to me, to understand my own feelings. And all of the advice that was all about driving traffic, whilst useful if that is your goal, just wasn&rsquo;t making me happy.</p>

<p>But, if that&rsquo;s not what I wanted, that does beg the question: <strong>What is the new site about then?</strong></p>

<p>Well, the site will mostly be the same. Technically, I wanted an overhal so that publishing was easier and simpler for me, in line with my original goal. But mainly, regarding content it&rsquo;s going to be more relaxed, as I want it to be more of a journal than a targetted set of articles.</p>

<p>And — really — that&rsquo;s it.</p>

<p>If you want to follow along, you&rsquo;re welcome to. And please let me know if there&rsquo;s anything you want to hear about! And here&rsquo;s to (hopefully a longer) new adventure!</p>

<p>Best, Lou.</p>
