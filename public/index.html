  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">I’m starting a fresh, with the website that is. I fully “launched” originally my previous website back in 2016. And along the way made a series of mistakes, that eventually lead to the total loss of my motivation and desire to write. So I’m doing some things differently, and making a come back… but this time, things are a little bit different!
Originally, whe vision was quite simple, and somewhat humble: share what I was learning and thinking about in a simple, candid way....</p>

    <h2 class="post-title">2018, a year in review</h2>
  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">Last year when I put out content around the new year about my plans I got a spike in traffic. I guess something about the personal nature of the post was attractive. Based on how much people seemed to like those posts, I thought I’d do another. A round up of 2018 — and a goal set for 2019. Looking back at my goals for 2018, it seems apparent that I went into the year with a better head space than I came out of it....</p>

    <h2 class="post-title">Reading List</h2>
  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">Meditations by Marcus Aurelius, Letters from a Stoic, Seneca. This recommendation has to come first. This particular translation is great. It’s also a more condensed version which is easier to read (and fits in your pocket!). When I first heard about the Stoics, it wasn’t something I felt compelled to read. In fact, looking at the Penguin classic covers (I’m sad to say!) even made me recoil in pain. Years ago I even caught myself saying that I’m not interested in history before....</p>
